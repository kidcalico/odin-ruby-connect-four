# Connect Four for *The Odin Project*

Welcome to Connect Four, written in Ruby, to be run in the terminal.

The real challenge here was writing the tests *before* writing the code for
this connect four game. On the bright side, this whole process has shed a lot
of light on the utility of Test Driven Development. It is pretty damn cool 
how after spending so much time writing tests, the code seems to just magically 
work. I'm sold!
